\section{Abstract}
This report describes our design and implementation of the 5-stage pipelined processor, that follows Harvard architecture.

This report contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Overall system blocks and connections.
    \item Functionalities of the different blocks.
    \item Hazard solutions.
    \item Memory cache system design.
    \item Implementation and analysis of the full processor.
\end{itemize}
